# Contributing

**First off, thank you for your support! **

Here are some best practices to contribute to Eko:

The Eko project is open to contributions. I am only a single person,
so it may take some time to review your contributions. During this time
I will be prioritizing bug fixes. Regardless, I appreciate your support!

## Exploits

If you find a security exploit, please report it privately to me (Kyren223 on discord).

## Features

For new features, please **open an issue** prior to creating a pull request. This
allows me and the community to think about the change and provide feedback.

## Refactoring

If you are refactoring, please include a brief explanation for the changes and
how it will improve the project.

## Bug Fixes

If you are reporting a bug or creating a pull request, you must include clear
steps to showcase the issue before and after. Tests are preferred, but steps to
reproduce are also appreciated!

## Pull Requests

Contributions must pass all tests, and CI before merging. For me to
review your PR, I need tests or a reproducible example to showcase all changes.

If any of these are failing and you're struggling to debug the issue, please let
us know in your PR, otherwise we will assume it is a WIP.

Please only mark the pull request as "Ready for Review" when it is in fact
complete and ready for review.
