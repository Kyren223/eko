# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** August 4, 2025

## Stub Copy for Development Only!

**This is not the official privacy policy. It is included for local testing and layout purposes only.  
Do not use this version in production. The official public instance of Eko, hosted at `eko.kyren.codes`, has its own up-to-date privacy policy.**

This Privacy Policy shows how we handle markdown when you test our anonymous communication platform. The following sentence makes no sense and operates without any meaning at-all for exmaple such as names or email addresses. However, we do stuff (e.g. Some stuff) which may be considered some stuff.

## 1. What We Collect

This is an example of a bunch of bullets:

- **Some stuff** – for some reasons
- **Other stuff** – a stable 64-bit identifier generated on first login
- **Blabla** – includes some random things0
- **Hmmm** – such as API
- **CPU vs AI** (optional) – Motherboard, CPU, RAM, and programming-related bugs, [play it](https://github.com/the-memory-managers/cpu-vs-ai) now!

Of course now we need to write a really long paragraph that spans multiple lines just to make sure all the formatting works, so we will write a very long paragraph to fill up the text, and it should be at least a few lines. It'd also include a period that just continues like normally to end the sentence. Did you know that British people call a period a "full stop".

## 2. Making sure terms work

This is to make sure that the Terms of Service link appropriately when viewing directly on the website.

### Sub headers

- Bullet 2
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 0
- Bullet 255

This makes sure subheaders work appropariately

## This is some extra text

Of course now we need to write a really long paragraph that spans multiple lines just to make sure all the formatting works, so we will write a very long paragraph to fill up the text, and it should be at least a few lines.
